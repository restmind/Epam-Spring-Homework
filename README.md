# Spring_5 Web MVC Homework

#### Required:
1.	Extend your service functionality by implementing custom common and unified error handling functionality using Spring MVC components.

2.	Extend your service RESTful endpoints by adding HATEOAS links to the relative resources.

3.	Extend your service RESTful endpoints by adding versioning alongside Swagger 2 documentation.

4.	Get hands-on experience working with the RestTemplate:
    -	create a separate service that will make REST calls to your main service endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and parse the response.


Optional (would be a great plus):
1.	Get theoretical knowledge and practical experience working with the Spring MVC WebDataBinder. Sources:
